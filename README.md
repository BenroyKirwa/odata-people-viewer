# OData People Viewer

A web application that fetches people data from the OData API (`http://services.odata.org/TripPinRESTierService/People`) and displays it in a table with advanced features.

## Features
- Displays a list of people with columns: `UserName`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `MiddleName`, `Gender`, `Age`.
- Supports sorting by any column (ascending or descending) with multiple criteria.
- Supports filtering by any column with conditions (e.g., "Equals", "Contains", "Greater Than").
- Includes pagination (5 people per page).
- Updates the URL with sorting and filtering state for sharing.
- Shows a loader during data fetching, sorting, filtering, and resetting.
